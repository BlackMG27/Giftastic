# Giftastic
This is a app that works with the giphy api

## How this works:
1. The user could either enter a location that they would like to visit or choose from one of the buttons to the side
2. If the user clicks 'Add Location' a new button will be added to the list on the side
3. The user can click on buttons and select how many gifs they want and the number of gifs will appear.
  * The user will see the title, rating, source link, and the gif itself.
4. If the user clicks on the gif, it will animate
  * another click makes it still again.
